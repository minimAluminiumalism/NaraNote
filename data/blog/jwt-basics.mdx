JSON Web token(JWT) is an open standard which defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.
This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. JWTs can be signed using a secret (with the HMAC algorithm) or a public/private key pair using RSA or ECDSA.

JWT consist of three parts separated by dots(.): Header, Payload and Signature. a JWT typically looks like the following.


The first line is header, and the second line is payload, and the last line is signature.


```bash:JWT
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.

## Parts broken down

### Header

Header is typically consists of two part: the type of the token and the signing 
algorithm used, such as HMAC, SHA256 and RSA. The field `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9` is
 base4encoded and the clear text is following.

```bash:Header
 {
  "alg": "HS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
}
```

### Payload

Payload contains the claims which consists of key infomation. An example payload can be:

```bash:
{
  "p": "2",
  "t": 1642172692000,
  "b": "3217762",
  "w": 1000,
  "k": "{\"u\":\"xwB6a62fRZc=\",\"i\":\"XG+8ka3tPGSVpzE2IObupQ==\",\"t\":\"P2ODj+rhbTaw8NT/BbUOAQ==\",\"b\":\"oUQ+QqYwe34=\",\"n\":\"LPwOuFmCb3I=\"}",
  "iat": 1642172692
}
```
This part is also base64 encoded to form the second part of the JWT.


### Signature

Signature is generated by encoded header, encoded payload and the algorithm specified in the header(In the above header is `HMAC-SHA256`),
For example if you want to use the HMAC SHA256 algorithm, the signature will be created in the following way:

```bash:
HMACSHA256(
  base64UrlEncode(header) + "." +
  base64UrlEncode(payload),
  secret)
```

The `secret` field represents the private key to encrypt the payload. The signature is used to verify the message wasn't changed along the way.


## Programming tips


In Python, package like `PyJWT` and `python-jose` can sign and verify the jwt message. For example, `PyJWT` usage:

```Python: jwtGenerator
# jwt_data is dict and jwt_key is str. 

jwt_enc = jwt.encode(jwt_data, jwt_key, algorithm='HS256')
print(jwt_enc.decode(encoding='utf-8'))
```

In front-end, some sites use jwt as a confusion method for copyright protection. You can try to find the constent field jwt secret like `jwtSecret` in their 
JavaScript.
