summary: 'Setup Homebrew and Python dev env on Apple Silicon Mac'
---


The ARM architecture provides a poweful performance for our development but it's also a
barrier to setup dev environment quickly and easily. In this article, I will give my solution to setup a Python
dev env on Apple Silicon Mac.

## `i386`-`arm64` terminal switch

With `Rosetta`, `Terminal` can run in both `i386`(Intel) and `arm64`(ARM) mode.
On macOS, enter command `arch` you wil get the architecture info. We can duplicate the 
terminal and rename the duplication app with name started with `Rosetta-` like `Rosetta-terminal`.
Right click `Get info` and select `Open using Rosetta`, and this makes the app running in `i386` mode.
If you want to configure mode hint in terminal and switch these two modes quickly with several simple commands, check this [video](youtube.com/watch?v=EG-K5n20_HQ) 
and this [Gist](https://gist.github.com/joshdholtz/d1a7295c51e031a8de7e11c36f25ab61) for more tips.

## Homebrew installation

You can install Homebrew in two versions for their own architecture. Open `i386` and `amr64` terminal seperately, and enter the same 
command
```bash:
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Homebrew for i386 exists in path `/usr/local/homebrew/bin/brew` and the arm version exists in `/opt/homebrew/bin/brew`.
These are separate versions of each other.


## Python version management.

It seems that Python 3.9.1 is the first verison to support Apple Silicon Macs, so if you want to install an older 
version like 3.7.2, you should use i386 Homebrew.

At first I choose `asdf` as the version management tool, but unlike in this [video](youtube.com/watch?v=EG-K5n20_HQ), I always get an 
error `python-build: use zlib from xcode sdk... BUILD FAILED (OS X 12.0.1 using python-build 2.2.2-1-gf2925393)`. Actually the same error occured if I install 
Python 3.7.2 (which is not supported in Apple Silicon) with arm64 Homebrew directly. I haven't found the solution so far.

So I highly recommend `pyenv` as the version management tool. Maybe you will still get the error `BUILD FAILED (OS X ...)...`, the solution 
is [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66482346/problems-installing-python-3-6-with-pyenv-on-mac-os-big-sur)

### Solution for `Xcode Build failed` error

```bash:
CFLAGS="-I$(brew --prefix openssl)/include -I$(brew --prefix bzip2)/include -I$(brew --prefix readline)/include -I$(xcrun --show-sdk-path)/usr/include" LDFLAGS="-L$(brew --prefix openssl)/lib -L$(brew --prefix readline)/lib -L$(brew --prefix zlib)/lib -L$(brew --prefix bzip2)/lib" pyenv install --patch 3.7.2 < <(curl -sSL https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/8ea6353.patch\?full_index\=1)
```

Attention for the version tag `3.7.2` in this command, if you want to install a different version, change the tag.
