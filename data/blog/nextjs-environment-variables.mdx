summary: 'Use the built-in function of Next.js to configure environment variables.'

Generally there are two different ways to set environment variables depending on your runtime environment.


## 1. Loading Environment Variables directly

Next.js has built-in support for loading environment variables from `.env.local` into `process.env`. If you only want to 
use variables in server side, you can add them in `.env.local` without any modification.

```js:
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=myuser
DB_PASS=mypassword
```

In server side call them by add prefix `process.env.`

```js:
export async function getStaticProps() {
  const db = await myDB.connect({
    host: process.env.DB_HOST,
    username: process.env.DB_USER,
    password: process.env.DB_PASS,
  })
  // ...
}
```


## 2. Exposing Environment Variables to the Browser

By default environment variables are only available in Node.js(backend) environment, to expose it to browser(frontend), 
you have to prefix the variable with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` which is similar to pure React program with `REACT_APP_`.

```js:
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL = 'http://localhost:8000/'
```

When use it in project, use `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`.
