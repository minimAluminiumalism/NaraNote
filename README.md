# NaraNote

## Overview

```NaraNote``` is toally inspired and modified by [leerob.io](https://github.com/leerob/leerob.io) with pure and tiny functions of blog and code snippets archive. I removed many original functions like YouTube video, adding tweets in blog, Spotify and Unsplash share to give writer a pure experience of recording and writing.


This repo can be a blog template for programming freshmen as long as you only need to modify some introduction or description in the page and replace the files in the `data` directory.
